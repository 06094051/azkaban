Azkaban2 is a scheduler for running work flows.
Nearly completely rewritten, Azkaban2 stores, manages and tracks jobs that comprise various workflows.

LinkedIn has been running this new version of Azkaban since November 2012. This replaces the the original version of Azkaban ran since 2009.

We apologize for the lack of documentation at the moment. We are still in the process of writing documents and hope to have them out shortly.
So please direct questions to Richard Park at rpark@linkedin.com if you want to get started early on using Azkaban2.
