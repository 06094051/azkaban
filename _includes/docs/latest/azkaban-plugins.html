<h3>Execute-As-User</h3>

<p>With a new security enhancement in Azkaban 3.0, Azkaban jobs can now run as the submit user or the user.to.proxy of the flow.  This ensures that Azkaban takes advantage of the Linux permission security mechanism, and operationally this simplifies resource monitoring and visibility.  Set up this behavior by doing the following:-</p>

<ol>
	<li>add execute.as.user=true to azkaban-pluginâ€™s commonprivate.properties (should be there by default)</li>
	<li>configure azkaban.native.lib= to the place where you are going to put the compiled execute-as-user.c file (see below)</li>
	<li>Generate an executable on the Azkaban box for azkaban-common/src/main/c/execute-as-user.c. <b> it should be named execute-as-user </b> Below is a sample approach</li>
		<ul> 
			<li>scp <code>./azkaban-common/src/main/c/execute-as-user.c</code> onto the Azkaban box</li>
			<li>run: gcc execute-as-user.c -o execute-as-user</li>
			<li>run: chown root execute-as-user (you might need root privilege)</li>
			<li>run: chmod 6050 execute-as-user (you might need root privilege)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
