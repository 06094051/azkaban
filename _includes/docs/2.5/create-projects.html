<p>If you are just starting out, the project page may be empty. However you can see all the existing projects by clicking on __All Projects__.</p>

<p>Clicking on __Create Projects__ will pop open a dialog box. Enter in a unique project name and description of the project. The description can be changed in the future, but the project name cannot be. If you don't see this button, it is likely that the ability to create new projects has been locked down except for users with the proper permissions.</p>
