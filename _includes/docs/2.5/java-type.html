<h2 id="java-type">Java Job Type</h2>

<p>The java job type was widely used in the original Azkaban as a built-in type. It is no longer a built-in type in Azkaban2. The "javaprocess" is still built-in in Azkaban2. The main difference between "java" and "javaprocess" job types are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>_javaprocess_ runs user program that has a "main" method, _java_ runs Azkaban provided main method which invokes user program "run" method.</li>
  <li>Azkaban can do the setup, such as getting Kerberos ticket or requesting hadoop tokens in the provided main in _java_ type, whereas in _javaprocess_ user is responsible for everything.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, most users use _java_ type for running anything that talks to hadoop clusters. That usage should be replaced by _hadoopJava_ type now, which is secure. But we still keep _java_ type in the plugins for backwards compatibility.</p>

<h3>How-To-Use</h3>

<p>Azkaban spawns a local process for the java job type that runs user programs. It is different from the "javaprocess" job type in that Azkaban already provides a "main" method, called "JavaJobRunnerMain". Inside "JavaJobRunnerMain", it looks for the "run" method which can be specified by "method.run" (default is "run"). User can also specify a cancel method in the case the user wants to gracefully terminate the job in the middle of the run.</p>

<p>For the most part, using _java_ type should be no different from _hadoopJava_ . </p>

<h3>Sample Job</h3>

<p>Please refer to _hadoopJava_ type.</p>
