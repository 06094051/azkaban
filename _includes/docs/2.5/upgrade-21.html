If installing Azkaban from scratch, you can ignore this document. This is only for those who are upgrading from 2.1 to 3.0.


# Upgrading DB from 2.1

The _update\_2.1\_to\_3.0.sql_ needs to be run to alter all the tables. This includes several table alterations and a new table.

Here are the changes:

* Alter project_properties table
	* Modify 'name' column to be 255 characters
* Create new table triggers


# Importing Existing Schedules from 2.1

In 3.0, the scheduling system is merged into the new triggering system. The information will be persisted in _triggers_ table in DB. We have a simple tool to import your existing schedules into this new table.

After you download and install web server, please run this command _once_ from web server install directory:

bash bin/schedule2trigger.sh
