<p>A job is a process you want to run in Azkaban. Jobs can be set up to be dependent on other jobs. The graph created by a set of jobs and their dependencies are what make up a flow. </p>

<h3> Creating Jobs</h3>

<p>Creating a job is very easy. We create a properties file with __.job__ extension. This job file defines the type of job to be run, the dependencies and any parameters needed to set up your job correctly.</p>

<pre class="code">
# foo.job
type=command
command=echo "Hello World"
</pre>

<p>In the example, the _type_ of job is _command_. The _command_ parameter is a parameter that the _command_ job type understands. In this case, it will run the command to print "Hello World". Standard output and the standard error of the job are written to logs which are viewable in the Azkaban Web UI.</p>

<P>For more information about jobs, see the [jobs configuration](./jobconf.html) page.</p>

<h3>Creating Flows</h3>

<p>A flow is a set of jobs that depends on one another. The dependencies of a job always run before the job itself can run. To add dependencies to a job, add the __dependencies__ property as shown in the following example.</p>

<pre class="code">
#foo.job
type=command
command=echo foo
</pre>

<pre class="code">
#bar.job
type=command
dependencies=foo
command=echo bar
</pre>

<p>The _dependencies_ parameter takes a comma separated list of job names. Make sure that the job names exist and that there are no cyclical dependencies.</p>

<p>A flow is created for every job that has no job dependent on it, and the flow is given the same name as the job. For instance, in the above example, _bar_ depends on _foo_, but nothing depends on _bar_. So a flow will be created with the name _bar_.</p>

<h3>Uploading Flows</h3>

<p>To upload the flow, all that is required is that all of your _.job_ and any binaries that need to be executed are archived in a _.zip_ file. Through the Azkaban UI, you can then deploy your workflow. The flow will be validated for missing or cyclical dependencies. See [project uploads](./projectupload.html).</p>
