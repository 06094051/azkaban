<h2 id='upload-projects'>Upload Projects</h2>

<p>Click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button. You will see the following dialog.</p>
<img ALT='Upload' class='shadowimg' src='./images/uploadprojects.png' title='Upload' width='400' />
<p>Select the archive file of your workflow files that you want to upload. Currently Azkaban only supports *.zip files. The zip should contain the *.job files and any files needed to run your jobs. Job names must be unique in a project.</p>

<p>Azkaban will validate the contents of the zip to make sure that dependencies are met and that there&#8217;s no cyclical dependencies detected. If it finds any invalid flows, the upload will fail.</p>

<p>Uploads overwrite all files in the project. Any changes made to jobs will be wiped out after a new zip file is uploaded.</p>

<p>After a successful upload, you should see all of your flows listed on the screen.</p>
