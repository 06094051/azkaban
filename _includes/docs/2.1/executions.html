<h3 id='flow_execution_page'>Flow Execution Page</h3>

<p>After <a href='./executingflow.html'>executing a flow</a> you will be presented the Executing Flow page. Alternatively, you can access these flows from the <a href='./projectflowview.html'>Flow View</a> page under the Executions tab, the History page, or the Executing page.</p>

<p>This page is similar to the Flow View page, except it shows status of running jobs.</p>
<img ALT='Executing Flow Page' class='shadowimg' src='./images/executingflowpage.png' title='Executing Flow' width='450' />
<p>Selecting the Job List will give a timeline of job executions. You can access the jobs and job logs directly from this list.</p>
<img ALT='Executing Flow Page' class='shadowimg' src='./images/executingflowpagejobslist.png' title='Executing Flow' width='450' />
<p>This page will auto update as long as the execution is not finished.</p>

<p>Some options that you are able to do on execution flows include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cancel</strong> -kills all running jobs and fails the flow immediately. The flow state will be KILLED.</li>

<li><strong>Pause</strong> -prevents new jobs from running. Currently running jobs proceed as usual.</li>

<li><strong>Resume</strong> -resume a paused execution.</li>

<li><strong>Retry Failed</strong> -only available when the flow is in a FAILED FINISHING state. Retry will restart all FAILED jobs while the flow is still active. Attempts will appear in the Jobs List page.</li>

<li><strong>Prepare Execution</strong> -only available on a finished flow, regardless of success or failures. This will auto disable successfully completed jobs.</li>
</ul>
