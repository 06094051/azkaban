#Job Details

From an execution page, after clicking "Job List" and then "Details" for one of the jobs, you will arrive at the job details page. This page contains tabs for the "Job Logs" and a "Summary".

##Job Logs
The job logs are stored in the database. They contain all the stdout and stderr output of the job.
