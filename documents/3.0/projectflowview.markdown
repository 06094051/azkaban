#Flow View

By clicking on the flow link, you can go to the Flow View page. From here, you'll be shown a graph representation of the flow.
The left panel contains a list of jobs in your flow. 

Right clicking on either the jobs in the right panel or the nodes in the
graph will allow you to open individual jobs. You are also able to Schedule and Execute Flows from this page.
