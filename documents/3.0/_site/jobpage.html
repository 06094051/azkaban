<h1 id='jobs'>Jobs</h1>

<p>Jobs make up individual tasks of a flow. To get to the jobs page, you can right click on a job in the Flow View, the Executing Flow view or the Project Page.</p>

<p>From this page you can see the dependencies and dependents for a job as well as the global properties that the job will use.</p>

<h3 id='job_edit'>Job Edit</h3>

<p>Clicking on Job Edit will allow you to edit all the job properties except for certain reserved parameters, such as <em>type</em>, and <em>dependencies</em>. The changes to the parameters will affect an executing flow only if the job hasn&#8217;t started to run yet. These overwrites of job properties will be overwritten by the next project upload.</p>

<h3 id='job_history'>Job History</h3>

<p>The Job history page will show a history of executions for a job in a flow as well as access to their logs. The logs have a retention policy and is by default purged after a month, although the execution information persists. The graph shows the runtimes for the jobs that appear on that page.</p>

<p>Any retries of a job will show as <em>executionid.attempt number</em>.</p>
