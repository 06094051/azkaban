<h1 id='creating_flows'>Creating Flows</h1>

<p>A job is a process you want to run in Azkaban. Jobs can be set up to be dependent on other jobs. The graph created by a set of jobs and their dependencies are what make up a flow.</p>

<h3 id='creating_jobs'>Creating Jobs</h3>

<p>Creating a job is very easy. We create a properties file with <strong>.job</strong> extension. This job file defines the type of job to be run, the dependencies and any parameters needed to set up your job correctly.</p>
<pre class='code'>
# foo.job
type=command
command=echo "Hello World"
</pre>
<p>In the example, the <em>type</em> of job is <em>command</em>. The <em>command</em> parameter is a parameter that the <em>command</em> job type understands. In this case, it will run the command to print &#8220;Hello World&#8221;. Standard output and the standard error of the job are written to logs which are viewable in the Azkaban Web UI.</p>

<p>For more information about jobs, see the <a href='./jobconf.html'>jobs configuration</a> page.</p>

<h3 id='creating_flows'>Creating Flows</h3>

<p>A flow is a set of jobs that depends on one another. The dependencies of a job always run before the job itself can run. To add dependencies to a job, add the <strong>dependencies</strong> property as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class='code'>
#foo.job
type=command
command=echo foo
</pre><pre class='code'>
#bar.job
type=command
dependencies=foo
command=echo bar
</pre>
<p>The <em>dependencies</em> parameter takes a comma separated list of job names. Make sure that the job names exist and that there are no cyclical dependencies.</p>

<p>A flow is created for every job that has no job dependent on it, and the flow is given the same name as the job. For instance, in the above example, <em>bar</em> depends on <em>foo</em>, but nothing depends on <em>bar</em>. So a flow will be created with the name <em>bar</em>.</p>

<h3 id='uploading_flows'>Uploading Flows</h3>

<p>To upload the flow, all that is required is that all of your <em>.job</em> and any binaries that need to be executed are archived in a <em>.zip</em> file. Through the Azkaban UI, you can then deploy your workflow. The flow will be validated for missing or cyclical dependencies. See <a href='./projectupload.html'>project uploads</a>.</p>
