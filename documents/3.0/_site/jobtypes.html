<h1 id='plugins'>Plugins</h1>

<p>Azkaban job type plugin design provides great flexibility for developers to create any type of job executors which can work with essentially all types of systems &#8211; all managed and triggered by the core Azkaban work flow management.</p>

<p>Here we provide a common set of plugins that should be useful to most hadoop related use cases, as well as sample job packages. Most of these job types are being used in LinkedIn&#8217;s production clusters, only with different configurations. We also give a simple guide how one can create new job types, either from scratch or by extending the old ones.</p>
