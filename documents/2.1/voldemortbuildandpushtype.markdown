#Permissions
When you start Azkaban, you may notice the login page. Azkaban makes you authenticate before you can use it. This is prevent seeing or executing workflows you shoudn't see or touch.
We also used authenticated users for auditing purposes. Whenever project files change, is modified, scheduled, etc. we often want to
know which user performed that action.


## UserManager



## Project Permissions

A project owner can control which user can perform certain actions on a project.
