#Plugins

Azkaban is designed to be modular. We are able to plug in code to add viewer pages or
execute jobs in a customizable manner. These pages will describe the azkaban-plugins that
can be downloaded from [the download page](../../downloads.html) and how to extend
Azkaban by creating your own plugins or extending an existing one.
